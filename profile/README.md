# Modernism in Architecture
### An archive of buildings and architects to create visibility for modernist architecture in different places of the world. 

Modernism in architecture is referred to by many names, depending on the region, language and context, e.g. Neues Bauen, Bauhaus, klassische Moderne, International Style, De Stijl, Razionalismo, Avant-garde, Interwar-Style, Modernist Era and many more. 

We dedicate this archive to all who share our interest and passion for the architecture of the interwar period (1920s-1940s), its architects and stories. Enjoy! Read more about us and the project [here](https://modernism-in-architecture.org/about/).
